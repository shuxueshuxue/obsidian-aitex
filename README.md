Greetings, Mathemagicians! We present to you AItex, a trusty sidekick on your journey through the maze of mathematical formulae in the land of Obsidian. We've been chatting with the wizards at OpenAI, who gave us a nifty tool called the OpenAI API.

Features
--------

Just like the best magical artifacts, AItex has some cool tricks up its sleeve:

* A spell of Binding: AItex is tightly bound with Obsidian, ready to aid you at a moment's notice.
* Whispering to Spirits: The core of AItex's magic is the OpenAI API, a mystical entity we converse with to understand your numerical notations.

Installation
------------

Before you summon AItex, ensure your Obsidian grimoire is of v1.3.0 or a newer edition.

Now, hold onto your hats because AItex isn't just sitting around in the Obsidian market. You'll need to conjure it up manually, and don't forget to obtain an OpenAI API key â€“ it's our magic phrase to call upon the OpenAI spirits.

Usage
-----

Here's how to wield AItex's magic:

* With a swift double backslash (\\\\) then press enter: Invoke AItex to cast a spell that restructures the math puzzle on your current line.
* With a powerful triple backslash (\\\\\\) then press enter: AItex uses a more potent charm, useful for grand challenges like the daunting 3x3 matrix.

Contributing
------------

Fellow wizards and witches, we welcome your magical insights! If you have enhancements or improvements, please clone our spellbook (i.e., fork the repository), make your mystical modifications, and submit a scroll with your changes (pull request).

Contact
-------

If you need a magical consultation or have ideas to share, send us an owl! We're always eager to hear from fellow enchanters.

We tip our hats to the arcane masters at OpenAI. Without their mystic API, AItex would be just another ordinary wand.
